## Setting up a Windows Development environment 

 

Howdoi can be used on Windows, MacOS and Linux etc. But the development environment can only be set up in a Linux or Mac. To set up the development environment in Windows, follow the following steps: 

### Install WSL: 

WSL is Windows Subsystem for Linux. It offers Linux interoperability in Windows and allows users to set up a virtual environment. 

If you do not have WSL set up, follow the steps in this [tutorial] (https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10) 

### Setting up the virtual environment: 

After setting up WSL, go to the directory where you want to set up Howdoi. Open the Command Prompt here and enter the following to enter the WSL environment. 

``` bash
bash 
``` 

Now you are using the Linux-compatible kernel on Windows and can set up a virtual environment. 

### Clone the git repository: 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi.git 
``` 

Setup and activate a virtual environment: 

``` bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv 
$ source .venv/bin/activate 
``` 

Make sure you have pip installed, if not, enter: 

``` bash
$ sudo apt install python3-pip 
``` 

Go to the project directory and install requirements: 

``` bash
$ cd howdoi 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
``` 

> if howdoi does not process queries after this command, make sure your PATH variables for Python and Pip are set correctly in Windows environment variables.  

### Test run: 

Check to see if everything has been set-up correctly: 

```  bash
pip install howdoi 
howdoi  print hello world
```
