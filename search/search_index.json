If there are no current or past issues similar to yours, be sure to give a a complete description when creating it. Wait for feedback on the issue before starting to work. Tip Include instructions on how to reproduce the bug you found or specific use cases of a requested feature. Note Follow Github's guide to collaborating efficiently . Setting up development environment \u00b6 Clone the git repository $ git clone https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi.git Setup and activate a virtual environment $ python3 -m venv .venv $ source .venv/bin/activate Install packages $ pip install -r requirements.txt Running howdoi \u00b6 Run on the command-line python -m howdoi QUERY Note If you try running python howdoi/howdoi.py (without -m ) you might get ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package . If you want to use howdoi from within a python script, just pass your query to howdoi.howdoi() from howdoi import howdoi query = \"for loop python\" output = howdoi . howdoi ( query ) Or parse it yourself and passed the arguments to howdoi.howdoi() from howdoi import howdoi query = \"for loop python\" parser = howdoi . get_parser () args = vars ( parser . parse_args ( query . split ( ' ' ))) output = howdoi . howdoi ( args ) Attention Parsing queries yourself is the older way to pass in queries and may be deprecated in the future. Prefer the first example. Submitting Pull Requests \u00b6 Before PRs are accepted they must pass all Travis tests and not have any flake8 or pylint warnings or errors. Testing \u00b6 Howdoi uses python's unittest library for unit testing. Run the unit tests locally $ python -m test_howdoi It's also possible to run only specific tests $ python -m unittest test_howdoi.TestClass.test_method Make sure all tests pass before submitting a PR. Tip Remmember to run the tests while inside the virtual environment (run source .venv/bin/activate to activate it). Linting \u00b6 Run linting locally with flake8 $ flake8 Or pylint $ pylint * Tip Howdoi uses vanilla configuration files for both linters ( .flake8rc and .pylintrc in the root directory), but with a max line length of 119 characters.
